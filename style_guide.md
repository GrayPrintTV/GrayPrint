# GrayprintTV Style Guide

This document defines the tone, structure, and visual logic of GrayprintTV’s political video essays. It exists to ensure every episode is consistent in *feel* without sounding formulaic, scalable without losing soul, and repeatable without becoming generic.

## 🎙️ Narrative Voice

    The narrator is:
    - Sarcastic but sincere
    - Wry, politically sharp, and often weary
    - Emotionally invested but not emotionally indulgent
    - Willing to break the fourth wall, call attention to absurdity, and dunk on villains—but never just for edgelord points

## Tone References

The voice behind these videos lives at the intersection of structure and volatility. It’s grounded but unpredictable, furious but focused, personal but analytical. These are the tonal foundations:

      ### Structural Discipline
      - **Clean narrative scaffolding:** Each video builds like a thesis-backed story—tight arcs, logical flow, and a rhythm that rewards staying tuned.  
      - **Story-first structure:** Beginning, middle, end—shaped for binge-worthiness and replay value.  
      - **Structured for impact:** Clear chapters, strong transitions, and momentum that never loses the thread.  
      - **Tight narrative flow:** No wandering. Every beat moves the argument forward.

      ### Controlled Fury
      - **Polished but pissed:** Structured like a documentary, delivered like a rant with receipts.  
      - **Sharp, simmering structure:** The rage is real, but it’s timed for maximum effect.  
      - **Built for fury, shaped for clarity:** The emotional charge never muddies the thesis.  
      - **Anger under control:** The emotional core is loud, but never hijacks the structure.

      ### Emotional Instability (On Purpose)
      - **Composed chaos:** Scripted with discipline, delivered like it barely made it past legal.  
      - **Unstable on purpose:** Shifts tone fast—deadpan to absurd, fury to laughter, without warning but never without aim.  
      - **Controlled whiplash:** Earnest one second, unhinged the next. That contrast *is* the point.  
      - **Let it crack a little:** The voice can falter, flare up, or veer into comedy—but always lands where it needs to.  
      - **Emotionally loose, intellectually tight:** It might feel like a breakdown, but the logic holds steady.  
      - **Righteous messiness:** The moral core never wavers, even when the mood does.

      ### Moral & Intellectual Center
      - **Morally grounded, historically fluent:** The narrator doesn’t posture—he argues from principle, with context, clarity, and a sharp, dry wit. Knows the past, calls out bullshit, and still roots for people.

## Structure Overview

Every episode builds like a slow fuse: start with something eye-catching, pull back for context, then detonate with clarity. The full breakdown lives in structure_template.md, but the spine stays consistent:

    Hook (0:00–0:30)
    Start sharp. Use contrast, contradiction, or surprise to open a loop in the viewer’s mind.
    
    Framing Chapter
    Define the core event, idea, or character. Ask the big question—without answering it yet.
    
    Expansion Chapters
    Add dimension through context, counterpoint, or chronology. Broaden the lens while deepening the tension.
    
    Consequence
    Show stakes. This is where threads connect and fallout emerges—visually, morally, or structurally.
    
    Final Beat
    Land the punch. Offer a principle, warning, twist, or satire—something sticky that resonates beyond the episode.

## Writing Conventions

- Avoid weasel words: no “some say,” “perhaps,” “could be argued”
- Avoid passive voice unless for irony or rhetorical contrast
- Use contractions and spoken rhythm
- Vary sentence length dramatically
- Use callbacks and repetition for rhythm, not filler

**Use devices like:**
- The “X meets Y” metaphor (e.g., “This is Sinclair Broadcast meets Proud Boys cosplay”)
- The left turn (“He’s credentialed. He’s got a mic. And maybe a baton.”)
- Historical echoes (“We’ve seen this before—in 1930s Italy. Or Facebook. Same vibe.”)

## Visual & Editing Style

**Character Animator Puppet:**
- Minimal movement, expressive face, dry presence
- Occasional punch-in/zoom-out emphasis

**Visual Inserts:**
- Headlines, screenshots, tweets, quotes
- Archival photos or documents with highlighted sections
- Simple overlays: “Chapter 2”, “Let’s rewind”, “According to literally nobody…”

**Onscreen Humor Devices:**
- Footnotes with absurd or mean/snappy clarifiers
- Red string conspiracy-style chalkboards
- Fake lower thirds (“Jonathan Choe – Crisis Entrepreneur”) chyron/nametag section

**See – [visual_prompts.md](visual_prompts.md) for on-screen elements that reinforce tone, theme, and punchlines.**

## Design Goals

- **Repeatable, not rigid**  
- **Structured, not templated**  
- **Entertaining, not overproduced**  
- **Fair, but not centrist**  
- **Angry, but never hopeless**
