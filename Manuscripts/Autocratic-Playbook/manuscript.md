TITLE: The Autocratic Playbook: How Judicial Collapse Begins

\[INTRODUCTION]
When courts collapse, democracy dies—slowly, quietly, legally. It doesn’t start with tanks. Or tribunals. It starts with paperwork—and silence. That’s not just a warning—it’s a pattern we’ve already seen play out in Belarus, Poland, and Türkiye. And unless we pay attention, it’s a path the United States could follow too.

We’re going to walk through three key tactics drawn straight from the autocrat’s playbook: media capture, bureaucratic purges, and fear-based enforcement. But none of them are step one. They all begin the same way—with the weakening of the judiciary.

\[JUDICIAL COLLAPSE: THE TRIGGER]
Judicial collapse doesn’t always mean courts are abolished. It starts with quieter moves: political pressure on judges, manipulating appointments, ignoring rulings, or discrediting the courts in public.
In a healthy democracy, courts are the firewall. They strike down illegal power grabs and keep each branch of government in check. That’s the principle of judicial review. It keeps laws inside the lines. When that firewall fails, the flood comes fast. Emergency powers go unchecked. Media becomes propaganda. Experts are purged. Dissidents vanish.

Let’s look at what happens when that firewall is dismantled—starting with Poland.

\[CASE STUDY: POLAND — MEDIA CAPTURE]
Take Poland.
Poland’s ruling party sidelined the judiciary, removing any legal barrier to seizing control of public broadcasters. Constitutional judges were packed with loyalists, and disciplinary bodies punished those who resisted. The result? Public media transformed into a mouthpiece for the government. Private outlets technically remained, but faced financial pressure, regulatory obstacles, and a chilling effect that made honest reporting risky. Sound familiar? In the United States, NPR and PBS face persistent defunding threats. Independent media outlets endure lawsuits, economic retaliation, and smear campaigns designed to undermine their legitimacy. This isn’t Poland. But the echo? Unmistakable. And once the courts stopped intervening, the facts didn’t disappear. They just stopped being allowed on air. Democracy doesn’t survive long on a diet of propaganda.

\[CASE STUDY: TÜRKIYE — THE EXPERTISE PURGE]
Next up: Türkiye.
Now let’s turn to Türkiye, where the judiciary became something worse than silent—it became complicit. Judges became rubber stamps—clearing mass purges without question. After the 2016 coup attempt, thousands of judges were purged and replaced by political appointees. Over 160,000 teachers, bureaucrats, and public workers were fired. This wasn’t a personnel shuffle—it was a systematic dismantling of institutional expertise. And in the United States, we’ve begun laying the groundwork for this strategy too. Proposals like Project 2025 outline mass firings based on ideological loyalty. If it sounds familiar, it should. Replace experts with loyalists, and democracy drifts. It loses memory. And competence.

\[CASE STUDY: BELARUS — ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES]
And finally: Belarus.
In Belarus, things go even darker. With courts stacked and prosecutors answering directly to the regime, even trials became theater. Courts have been weaponized to legalize the regime’s most authoritarian acts—secret arrests, disappearances, and detentions under vague charges of “extremism.” The message is clear: speak out, and you may vanish. And while the United States hasn’t gone that far yet, there are disquieting signs. Masked ICE raids, secretive detentions, and a growing tolerance for extrajudicial enforcement all bear a troubling resemblance. When courts stop demanding due process, fear replaces justice. The courts become tools of terror—not shields against it.

\[THE U.S. TODAY — ECHOES, NOT YET COLLAPSE]
So where does that leave the United States? We haven’t crossed the line. But we’re close enough to see it. Loyalty tests, executive overreach, and constant attacks on judicial legitimacy are slowly eroding the independence of our courts. Because once a court bows, it rarely stands back up.

\[WHY IT MATTERS — AND WHAT TO DO]
That’s why this matters. Because when the courts go, everything else follows. Rebuilding takes decades. Undermining? Just a few appointments. A few shrugged-off rulings.

But there’s still time to pull back. Supporting organizations that defend judicial independence. Like the ones that file lawsuits when nobody else is watching. Paying close attention to court nominations—yes, even the ones buried in the news cycle. Calling out efforts to delegitimize judges. Pressuring elected officials to protect the courts.

Judicial collapse doesn’t start with a bang. It starts with a shrug. And it ends with a purge. Because that’s what happens when a judge stays silent, and a court looks the other way. It’s not glamorous. No merch. No headlines. But it’s the only firewall we’ve got. And once that firewall burns down, the fire doesn’t stop—it spreads. This isn’t theoretical. It’s straight from the autocratic playbook—step by step, and we’re already on the page marked 'Judiciary.' If we keep our courts strong and independent, we can hold the line. And we can hold onto democracy.

Courts alone don’t save democracy. But without them, democracy doesn’t survive the first blow—let alone get a second chance.
